Laravel + React JSX Starter Kit
🚀 Introduction
This is a JSX-based version of the Laravel React Starter Kit. It provides a modern and minimalist setup for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using Inertia.

Unlike the original version, this kit removes TypeScript and uses plain JavaScript (.jsx instead of .tsx), making it easier for developers who prefer JavaScript over TypeScript.

This kit includes React 19, JavaScript, TailwindCSS 4, and modern UI libraries like shadcn/ui and Radix UI to help you build fast and beautiful applications.
